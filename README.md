# Boxing-Database-CS61

Project written in MySQL for Dartmouth CS61 in Summer 2023. Two boxing datasets containing data on fighters and popular bouts were downloaded from Kaggle. The data included in these datasets was scraped from https://boxstat.co/, which contains documentation explaining specific statistics. The schema was then designed, modeled, and implemented using mysql and python scripts. More documentation on steps can be found on the github wiki for this project: https://github.com/nicholas-middelberg/Boxing-Database-CS61/wiki
